## Description
üîç This is an API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, add friend list, remove friend, and react to friends thoughts. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the mongoose ODM, and moment.js to format timestamps. The seed data is created using Insomnia.
To see how the API works using Insomnia, below link is the **walk-through demonstration videos**:
